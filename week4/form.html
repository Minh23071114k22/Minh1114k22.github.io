    The king chosen to be the King of Britain was bestowed with a mysterious power, a black primeval cursed energy native to Britain, but its power had waned and Artoria's father Uther Pendragon was said to be the last of its keepers, which is why he came up with his plan to sire a manmade child of a human and a Dragon.[14]

Merlin once foretold how the white dragonWP representing the SaxonsWP and the red dragonWP representing Britain would battle each other, and then afterward Britain would be united by a great king who would defeat the Gauls and Romans.[15]

    Later, when Mordred joins Scáthach's search party to the coast for a chance to surf, Artoria tells her she'll double her workload. Eventually, she and the others learn from the search party that they're on the island as before 2000 years later. The group realizes they are the Nine Sisters. They decide against leaving the island by ship again as Scáthach points another thousand years may pass on the island, and the boar piglets may be extinct. They also decide they need to discover why the island's space-time is distorted as they continue to redevelop the island and make contact with Chaldea. They also meet with Cú Chulainn, who recently returned from being tossed overboard from the ship.
